# FreeRTOS on Atmel Xmega Example

This code is forked from klaxalk's fork fork of yuriykulikov's FreeRTOS port. I updated it to work with FreeRTOS 8.2.2 by fixing variable naming issues. I also made this project use code from Atmel Studio's ASF Framework rather than random code driver snippits. There could still be issues but it seems to be working very well for me.
